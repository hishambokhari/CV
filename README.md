I'm a full-stack software developer recently graduated from Makers Academy, who combines this strong technical knowledge with a year of start up business and management experience.

# Background

In the 2 years I spent in starting up and running a successful fitness centre, I realized my affinity to technology and the energy I got from solving problems. So I signed up to an intensive dev boot-camp and never looked back.

I'm trained in agile development at Makers, as well as pair programming, test-driven development (TDD) and object-oriented programming (OOP). I am highly empathetic, have a very intuitive understanding of user needs, and a strong knowledge of psychology backed by years of diverse client/staff engagement experience.

I want to bring my unique skill set, drive and commitment to a workplace with coding best practices, strong team dynamics, room to grow, and where the work I do has a clear purpose.

# Skills and qualities

#### Fittest Man of Pakistan 2017
One of my proudest moments was to receive the title of becoming the fittest man in Pakistan in 2017. 500 Individual men and women entered the competition. We were put through various different unannounced tasks that would test not only our physical but mental toughness and will to succeed. I was able to make my way to the top 10 finalist, eventually securing the 1st position and was awarded the title of the fittest in my home Country. [Here’s an article about the competition](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1547907/7-pakistan-gets-first-taste-crossfit-games/).

#### leadership & Adaptability
I’ve grown up in 2 different countries (Pakistan and the UK), attended several different schools and worked in roles that required me to quickly change based on the clients I was working with. In my role as a financial analyst at House of Habib Pakistan, I was required to fill the gap in short-staffed finance team last minute, and quickly familiarize myself with programme content, as well as build immediate rapport with clients and fellow employees.

#### High energy
I'm recognized for my energetic and highly proactive personality. One of my strongest qualities is my willingness to speak up and fully engage with the task at hand. This is why I really flourish in teams. For example, on the Moovli project at Makers Academy, I was particularly effective at being a driving force in the team, ensuring that I volunteered support to the scrum leader if they had to juggle too many responsibilities, or used my initiative to solve issues to avoid blockages in the workflow.

#### Resilience
I am a highly resilient person, particularly demonstrated in my experiences and challenges I faced setting up and running a successful fitness startup. On one occasion, I had to manage the entire startup on my own, from taking the role of a fitness instructor that led the classes, handled social media while promoting the brand using various marketing strategies, managed book keeping of the business, constantly reflecting on feedback from the customers to implement new and improved equipment/training methodologies and most importantly Introduced "SSTP" which stands for specific sports training program that catered to athletes that could not afford proper training to enhance their athletic abilities. In just three months, I was able build a team of 5 enthusiastic members that were equally as passionate towards the sport of fitness that lead to the start of a very special journey!
